    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Iâ€™m a software engineer with a strong foundation in civil engineering. I transitioned into tech to build impactful software that solves everyday problems. My focus is on full-stack development, web APIs, and system architecture.</p>
    <p>
        My programming journey began in 1985 when personal computers were just becoming mainstream. 
        I started with BASIC and assembly language, writing simple programs that sparked a lifelong 
        passion for creating digital solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout the 90s and 2000s, I evolved with the industry - from desktop applications to 
        the birth of the web, from static HTML pages to dynamic web applications. I've seen the 
        rise of JavaScript frameworks, the mobile revolution, and the cloud computing transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, I specialize in modern full-stack development, combining decades of experience with 
        cutting-edge technologies. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and mentoring the 
        next generation of developers.
